# Bearded Cyril

Bearded Cyril? It was the best name I could figure out... no, just joking, it was the recommendation from github and I though: why not ;)

## What is it?
Bearded Cyril will be a free to use template for let's say minimalistic photographers. But of course it could be used for many more. Maybe there will come a second repo with an wordpress template you can then use also like this template. If you have any ideas for more sections just open an issue ;)
