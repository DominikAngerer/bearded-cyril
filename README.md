# Bearded Cyril

Bearded Cyril? It was the best name I could figure out... no, just joking, it was the recommendation from github and I though: why not ;)

## What is this?
Bearded Cyril will be a free to use template for let's say minimalistic photographers. But of course it could be used for many more.

# Preview Socialbar ([Live Preview])
Added social bar to sidebar available @ the: Live Preview

## Easy to customize
You can simply customize this template by changing the variables already defined in the `variables.scss`. Which should look like this:
```scss
$fullwith-jump-if:790px;
$sidebar-bg-color:#22313F;
$sidebar-text-color:#fff;
$portfolio-item-height:200px;
```
As you can see these are only a few at the moment, but of course the amount of variables will grow and so will the customizability.
